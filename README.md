# CrossChain KYC Bridge (CCKB)
**CCKB** is an open-source Web3 KYC infrastructure that empowers a collaborative effort towards secure and efficient KYC solutions in the Web3 space. It leverages ERC-4671 standards and **integrates with existing centralized KYC providers**, offering flexibility for users and platforms. CCKB prioritizes security and user privacy by utilizing decentralized storage and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).
   
## Introduction  
Traditional Web3 platforms face challenges with KYC verification, often relying on centralized solutions or lacking efficiency. CCKB provides a user-centric and secure alternative. It offers two deployment models:  

- **Integrated Self-Managed Solution**: dApps can leverage CCKB's open-source code to streamline their KYC journey. They can deploy their own Soulbound KYC NFT smart contract and integrate with decentralized storage solutions like IPFS.  
- **CCKB Platform Managed**: dApps can onboard as valid issuers on the CCKB platform. CCKB manages the KYC process, including generating verifiable proofs and minting KYC NFTs.  
  
## Our Ecosystem Partners  
  
- **dApps (Decentralized Applications)**: CCKB empowers dApps to streamline user onboarding by offering a standardized and interoperable KYC infrastructure. By integrating CCKB, dApps can ensure regulatory compliance while focusing on core functionalities and user experience.  
- **Centralized KYC Providers**: Existing KYC providers can leverage CCKB's platform to gain access to a wider market of dApps seeking verified user identities. CCKB offers pre-audited smart contracts, reducing integration complexities for providers.  
- **Blockchain Developers**: CCKB's open-source codebase allows blockchain developers to contribute to the project's growth and foster a vibrant developer community. This collaborative environment fosters innovation and ensures CCKB remains adaptable to the evolving Web3 landscape.  
  
## Solving Seamless KYC for Next-Gen Applications  
  
Traditional KYC processes are often cumbersome and centralized, hindering the growth and adoption of next-generation Web3 applications. CCKB addresses these challenges by offering several key advantages:  
  
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless and transparent KYC infrastructure, minimizing reliance on centralized entities.  
- **Interoperable KYC Status**: Utilizes ERC-4671 standard Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to represent verified KYC status. This interoperability allows users to leverage their verified KYC across different blockchains and dApps.  
- **Flexible Deployment Models**: Caters to diverse needs by offering both self-managed and platform-managed solutions. dApps can choose the model that best suits their specific requirements.  
- **Privacy-Preserving ZKPs**: Integrates optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable users to reveal specific attributes without disclosing their entire KYC data, enhancing user privacy.      
    

## Infrastructure  
CCKB utilizes a modular architecture consisting of:  

- **Smart Contracts**: Soulbound Token (ERC-4671) for representing verified KYC status and managing token issuance/revocation.  
- **Decentralized Storage**: Stores hashed representations of KYC data (IPFS, Arweave) for enhanced security and privacy.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (Optional): Enables users to reveal specific attributes without disclosing all KYC data.  
- **Access Control Mechanisms**: Ensure authorized entities can access specific data upon user consent and following legal frameworks.  
   

## Benefits:

- **Improved KYC Efficiency:** Streamlines user onboarding and simplifies KYC verification for Web3 platforms.  
  
- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** Decentralized storage and ZKPs protect user data, minimizing data exposure.  
  
- **Transparency and Trust:** Open-source development to showcase quality, trust and community collaboration.  
  
- **Scalability and Interoperability:** Designed for future expansion and compatibility with different ecosystems.
