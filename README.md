# CrossChain KYC Bridge (CCKB)
**CCKB** is an open-source Web3 KYC infrastructure that streamlines KYC verification for various blockchain projects. It leverages ERC-4671 standards and **integrates with existing centralized KYC providers**, offering flexibility for users and platforms. CCKB prioritizes security and user privacy by utilizing decentralized storage and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

## Introduction  
Traditional Web3 platforms face challenges with KYC verification, often relying on centralized solutions or lacking efficiency. CCKB provides a user-centric and secure alternative. It offers two deployment models:  

- **Integrated Self-Managed Solution**: dApps can leverage CCKB's open-source code to streamline their KYC journey. They can deploy their own Soulbound KYC NFT smart contract and integrate with decentralized storage solutions like IPFS.  
- **CCKB Platform Managed**: dApps can onboard as valid issuers on the CCKB platform. CCKB manages the KYC process, including generating verifiable proofs and minting KYC NFTs.  
  
## Infrastructure  
CCKB utilizes a modular architecture consisting of:  

- **Smart Contracts**: Soulbound Token (ERC-4671) for representing verified KYC status and managing token issuance/revocation.  
- **Decentralized Storage**: Stores hashed representations of KYC data (IPFS, Arweave) for enhanced security and privacy.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (Optional): Enables users to reveal specific attributes without disclosing all KYC data.  
- **Access Control Mechanisms**: Ensure authorized entities can access specific data upon user consent and following legal frameworks.  


## Key Features:  
  

- **Secure and Private KYC**: Leverages decentralized storage and ZKPs to minimize data exposure.
- **Interoperable KYC Status**: ERC-4671 based KYC NFTs promote interoperability across platforms.
- **Flexible KYC Integration**: Supports both self-managed and platform-managed KYC processes.
- **Open-Source Development**: Fosters collaboration and continuous improvement.
- **User Control and Data Privacy**: Users control their data and can revoke access at any time. 
   

## Benefits:

- **Improved KYC Efficiency:** Streamlines user onboarding and simplifies KYC verification for Web3 platforms.  
  
- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** Decentralized storage and ZKPs protect user data, minimizing data exposure.  
  
- **Transparency and Trust:** Open-source development to showcase quality, trust and community collaboration.  
  
- **Scalability and Interoperability:** Designed for future expansion and compatibility with different ecosystems.
