# CrossChain KYC Bridge (CCKB)
CCKB is an open-source Web3 KYC platform that facilitates secure and efficient KYC verification for various blockchain projects. It leverages ERC-4671 standards and integrates with existing **centralized KYC providers**, offering flexibility for users and platforms.

## Key Features:

- **Decentralized Storage:** Sensitive KYC data is stored as hashed representations in decentralized storage solutions (IPFS, Arweave) for enhanced security and privacy.  
  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration:** Users can choose to reveal specific attributes (e.g., age verification) via ZKPs without disclosing all data, further enhancing privacy.  
  
- **ERC-4671 for KYC Status:** Non-transferable tokens (NFTs) represent verified KYC status, promoting interoperability across platforms.
Open-Source Development: Fosters collaboration and allows community contributions for continuous improvement and innovation.  
  
- **Interoperability:** Designed to be compatible with various blockchains and KYC providers, future-proofing the solution.  
  
- **User Control and Data Privacy:** Users have control over their data and can revoke access at any time. Access control mechanisms ensure only authorized entities can access specific data upon user consent and following relevant legal frameworks.  
  

## Benefits:

- **Improved KYC Efficiency:** Streamlines user onboarding and simplifies KYC verification for Web3 platforms.  
  
- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** Decentralized storage and ZKPs protect user data, minimizing data exposure.  
  
- **Transparency and Trust:** Open-source development fosters trust and community collaboration.  
  
- **Scalability and Interoperability:** Designed for future expansion and compatibility with different ecosystems.
